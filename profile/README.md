# ErvraTech

ErvraTech is an open, non-commercial engineering and research organization.

We publish **free and inspectable GitHub tools** focused on:
- structural signals in code evolution
- long-term maintainability risks
- non-intrusive developer insight

Our work avoids:
- tracking
- data collection
- external services
- monetization links

## Philosophy

We believe good tools should:
- explain, not judge
- assist, not enforce
- remain understandable by humans

## Projects

- **Drift Radar** — Structural PR drift detection (not a linter)

All repositories here are experimental, transparent, and open-source.
